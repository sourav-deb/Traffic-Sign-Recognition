# Traffic Sign Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

![Traffic Sign Recognition](hero-image.jpg)

## Overview

This project demonstrates Traffic Sign Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It involves training a deep learning model on a dataset of traffic sign images and then using the trained model to recognize traffic signs in real-world images or videos.

## Features

- Training a CNN model on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.
- Real-time traffic sign recognition using a webcam or processing images/videos.
- Accurate classification of various traffic sign types.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.13.1)
- OS 


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sourav-deb/traffic-sign-recognition.git
   cd traffic-sign-recognition

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
    pip install keras
    pip install os
    pip install tensorflow

3. Train the CNN model:

   ```bash
    open Jupyter-Notebook and RUN
    or
    upload in Google Colab and RUN
